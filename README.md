# GWI Favorites Service

A high-performance, concurrent-safe REST API service for managing user favorites across different asset types (Charts, Insights, and Audiences).

## 🏗️ Architecture

This service demonstrates enterprise-grade Go development practices:

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with domain, service, repository, and handler layers
- **Concurrency Safety**: Thread-safe operations using sync.RWMutex for high-throughput scenarios
- **Interface-driven Design**: Easily extensible with different storage backends
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and benchmark tests
- **Production Ready**: Graceful shutdown, structured logging, health checks, and Docker support

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality

- ✅ **Add assets to favorites** - Support for Charts, Insights, and Audiences
- ✅ **Remove assets from favorites** - Clean removal with proper error handling
- ✅ **List user favorites** - Paginated retrieval with configurable limits
- ✅ **Update asset descriptions** - Modify favorite asset descriptions
- ✅ **Check favorite status** - Verify if an asset is favorited

### Performance & Scalability

- ⚡ **Concurrent operations** - Thread-safe repository with read/write locks
- 📊 **Efficient pagination** - Handle large favorite lists with offset/limit
- 🔄 **Connection pooling ready** - Interface design supports database integration
- 📈 **Benchmarked performance** - Tested for high-throughput scenarios

### Production Features

- 🛡️ **Robust error handling** - Comprehensive error types and HTTP status codes
- 📝 **Structured logging** - JSON logging with contextual information
- 🏥 **Health checks** - Kubernetes/Docker-ready health endpoints
- 🐳 **Docker support** - Multi-stage builds and compose configuration
- 🔧 **Configuration management** - Environment-based configuration

## 📋 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Docker (optional)

### Running Locally

1. **Clone and setup**:

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd platform-go-challenge
go mod tidy
```

Run the service:

bash# Using Go directly
go run cmd/server/main.go

# Service will start on http://localhost:8080

Test the API:

bash# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Add a chart to favorites (Windows PowerShell)

$chartData = @'
{
  "id": "chart1",
  "type": "chart",
  "description": "Monthly sales performance",
  "title": "Sales Chart",
  "x_axis_title": "Month",
  "y_axis_title": "Revenue ($)",
"data": [{"x": "Jan", "y": 10000}, {"x": "Feb", "y": 15000}]
}
'@

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/users/user1/favorites" -Method POST -Body $chartData -ContentType "application/json"

# Get user favorites

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/users/user1/favorites"

Using Docker
bash# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t gwi-favorites-service .
docker run -p 8080:8080 gwi-favorites-service

Testing
bash# Run all tests
go test ./tests/unit/... -v

# Run with coverage

go test ./tests/unit/... -v -cover

API Endpoints
Method Endpoint Description
GET /health Health check endpoint
GET /api/users/{userID}/favorites Get user's favorites
POST /api/users/{userID}/favorites Add asset to favorites
DELETE /api/users/{userID}/favorites/{assetID} Remove from favorites
PUT /api/users/{userID}/favorites/{assetID} Update asset description
GET /api/users/{userID}/favorites/{assetID}/check Check if asset is favorite

Request/Response Examples
Add Chart to Favorites:
jsonPOST /api/users/user1/favorites
{
"id": "chart1",
"type": "chart",
"title": "Monthly Sales",
"x_axis_title": "Month",
"y_axis_title": "Revenue",
"description": "Sales performance data",
"data": [{"x": "Jan", "y": 10000}]
}

Add Insight to Favorites:
jsonPOST /api/users/user1/favorites
{
"id": "insight1",
"type": "insight",
"content": "40% of millennials spend 3+ hours on social media daily",
"description": "Social media usage insight",
"tags": ["social", "demographics"],
"category": "behavior"
}

Add Audience to Favorites:
jsonPOST /api/users/user1/favorites
{
"id": "audience1",
"type": "audience",
"description": "Tech-savvy millennials",
"gender": ["Male", "Female"],
"age_groups": ["25-34"],
"social_media_hours": "3+",
"purchases_last_month": 5
}

Asset Types
Chart
Represents data visualizations with axes and data points.
Insight
Text-based insights with categorization and tags.
Audience
User segments with demographic and behavioral characteristics.
🏢 Production Considerations
Current Implementation

Storage: In-memory with thread-safe operations
Authentication: User ID in URL (for demo purposes)
Scalability: Designed for easy database integration

Production Recommendations
Database Integration

PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible asset storage
Redis for caching frequently accessed favorites
Database sharding by user ID for horizontal scaling

Security Enhancements

JWT authentication with proper user validation
Rate limiting to prevent abuse
Input validation and sanitization

Monitoring & Observability

Metrics collection (Prometheus)
Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
Performance monitoring
Error tracking and alerting

🛠️ Development
Running Tests
bashgo test ./tests/unit/... -v
Building
bashgo build -o bin/gwi-favorites-service cmd/server/main.go
Docker
bashdocker build -t gwi-favorites-service .
docker run -p 8080:8080 gwi-favorites-service
💡 Design Decisions
Why In-Memory Storage?

Simplicity: No external dependencies for demo purposes
Performance: Fastest possible operations for benchmarking
Interface Design: Easy to swap with database implementation
Thread Safety: Demonstrates proper concurrent programming

Why This Architecture?

Testability: Clean separation allows for comprehensive testing
Maintainability: Clear boundaries between layers
Extensibility: Easy to add new asset types or storage backends
Production Ready: Patterns used in enterprise applications

Concurrency Approach

sync.RWMutex: Allows multiple concurrent reads
Granular Locking: Minimizes lock contention
Race Condition Prevention: All shared state properly protected
Performance: Optimized for high-throughput scenarios
